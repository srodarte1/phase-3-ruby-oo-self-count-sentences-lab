Alright, this is just for my own personal purposes.
Monkey Patching: altering ruby's built in methods. Stil need to understand what this means.
The practice of adding methods to or
altering Ruby's built-in classes is called **monkey patching**.


Monkey patching is dangerous, and should almost never be used in real
application. What if, for example, you decide to monkey patch Ruby's `String`
class to produce a quick-fix that shortens a certain section of code in your
program?

This really weird theory popped onto my brain wave…
So you know how every phase we have a module or two that will say, “hey, this is something you do not want to do, and you should avoid doing it, but here’s a lab on how to do that, even though esssentially we should not be doing it…we’re going to teach you how to do this. That is the first question that popped into my head when I was doing the monkey patching lab. I gotta say, this was interesting stuff. Like haker-ish type stuff?
So there I go, fresh out of Lewis Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland”, I fell down the rabbit hole and started googling..”do hackers monkey patch?” 


Monkey patching is the new black [in the Ruby community]. It's what all the hip kids are doing. To the point that smart, experienced hackers reach for a monkey patch as their tool of first resort, even when a simpler, more traditional solution is possible.

==> Is there a more simpler and traditional solution? And if so, which one is it? I miss NYC. I miss the East Coast...period. I
Patches interact in unpredictable, combinatoric ways.


Bugs caused by monkey patching are more difficult to track down than those introduced by traditional claases and methods. So in knowing this, is this what hackers are able to pinpiont and track? Are they able to target these specific classes and methods whenever they want to hack something? Or obviously, there are more advanced firewalss in place that take prescedint over what it is that we are tryin to prove here. Right? Like clearly nothing is this simple, most certaintly not hacking. Like they have to be way more adavanced than to just simply use monkey patching right? i guess you could say that I am just a big dreamer?/ Possibly right? Most undoubtedly. Ugh how much you want to bet he is going to play another game. I already know it. He never stops. Just oing to have to contkinue here. Yup i ws right. I fkn knew it. Ugh. fk this shit. such a motherfkn kid.


Seriously am dating a fkn kid. But you know what, this is exactly what i was talking about earlier. I need out of this shit. I need to learn to turn off my emotions for this one. I need to. I need to learn to just get by b/c this is not a good relationship for either of us. But we need to survive. So I think this is what needs to be the main focus. Surviving. But I do not think this is going to last between he and I and I most certainly do not want it to. He is very immature. Not that I am so prestrigiously righteous on my own doings but lets be honest, he is too much. I want someone who is more mature and, idk different about things. I recognize that he has been very helpful and makig sure that our needs have been met financially and food wise as well. Ugh but i know this is also because when the tables have turned and it is my turn to pull the financial weight, he is expecting just that. But....ugh If I am being honest...I don't see us being together for very long. There is just too much we do not like about each other, and he can feel it, just as much as I can feel it. We are not right for each other. But that is okay, it does not have to be such a big deal. We can drift apart, that is part of growing. and this is exactly what i think is happening to us. He should be with a girl that is younger than he is, and one that plays video games, someone that has the same financial goals that he does. We are just not compatable. I want to be healthy and eat right and go to the gym and read about new and healthy recipes, and cook them together. And learn about new biohacks and become excited to live a healthier life. Not a more lavishly and outrageously rich lifestyle, but one that brings more joy. We just do not see eye to eye on that one.
